Your life is like an epic journey, full of adventures waiting to be discovered. Let''s explore your story together.

To start, set aside 30 minutes ⏰ in a quiet space🧘🏻‍♀️ with pen and paper. 📝 

Think of a time when you faced mistreatment or abuse. Then, rewrites that story from a perspective of empowerment and growth, using these steps:

1️⃣Begin with the adventure: Describe the situation.
2️⃣Face the challenge: Talk about how you overcame it.
3️⃣Emerge stronger: Share how you became a better person because of it.

For example, if you were mistreated by a parent, you could focus on how it made you stronger, wiser, or more compassionate.

Remember, even tough times can lead to personal growth. Take inspiration from stories like  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin">Petr Kropotkin</a>, who found meaning and creativity even in prison.

Ask yourself questions like:

✔️What strengths did I gain from this experience?
✔️How has it shaped who I am today?
✔️What positives can I find in my journey?
✔️What makes my story unique?
✔️What opportunities came from my struggles?
✔️Why did life lead me down this path?

Take your time to write or draw your reflections. Good luck on your journey!

VALUES('ntr_setup_false', 'en', 'Welcome to the <b><u>Negative Thoughts Reframing Exercise!</u></b> ✏️ Let''s work together to challenge and change those negative thoughts that might be bringing you down. Here''s how:

1️⃣<b>Set a Time:</b> Decide when SELF LOVE will send you daily requests.

2️⃣<b>Spot Negative Thoughts:</b> Notice any negative thoughts or self-critical beliefs popping up during your day, like <i>"I''m not good enough"</i> or <i>"I''ll never succeed."</i>

3️⃣<b>Write Them Down:</b> Put one of those thoughts into the SELF LOVE bot. Describe it clearly, including how it makes you feel.

4️⃣<b>Question the Thought.</b> Challenge it by asking:

✔️Is it based on facts?
✔️What evidence supports or refutes it?
✔️Can I see this situation differently?
✔️How would I react if a friend felt this way?

5️⃣<b>Reframe the Thought:</b> Rewrite it in a more balanced, constructive way. For example:
Original: <i>"I''ll fail my final project because I''m not as good as others."</i>
Reframed: <i>"I may face challenges, but I''ll learn and grow from them."</i>

6️⃣<b>Be Kind to Yourself:</b> Remember to be gentle and patient as you do this. It''s okay to take your time.

7️⃣<b>Reflect on Progress:</b> Check in with yourself regularly. Notice any changes in how you think or feel. Celebrate your successes!

8️⃣<b>Get Support if Needed:</b> If you''re struggling, reach out to someone you trust for help. They can offer support and guidance along the way.', 'emodiary setup message');
