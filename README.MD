<H1>ABOUT THIS PROGRAM</H1>
Though the concept of “narcissism” is widespread. People attribute this word to a self-absorbed, overly admired with himself, and focused on the image, appearance, or position person (Howard, 2019). That is only partially true. From a psychological perspective, a narcissist is an individual exhibiting traits of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). The person with akin characteristics has an impact on his environment – the lives of the loved ones – he or she tends to manipulate, be cold, controlling, blaming, and aggressive (Määttä & Uusiautti, 2020). This unique type of maltreatment is called narcissistic abuse. 
The goal of the “Self-Love” Bot is to raise awareness of narcissistic abuse and help victims develop new skills for self-protection and healing or to seek professional help if needed. After the program user will be able to notice covert manipulations, react assertively in communication with an abuser, and have more positive self-talk than before taking the “Self- Love” course.
